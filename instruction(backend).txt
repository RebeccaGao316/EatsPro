For backend, we are using macOS but I believe it works on PC also. There are 2 options to use the backend app.
1) Using heroku(recommend)
I deploy it on heroku, link is:
https://guarded-headland-65550.herokuapp.com/
If it displays "RelatedObjectDoesNotExist at /restaurant/order/", it is because that you are in admin account(user shouldn't know it.) Please go to https://guarded-headland-65550.herokuapp.com/admin and log out the superuser, then go back to https://guarded-headland-65550.herokuapp.com/

2)local server
2.1 Download backend code to somewhere
2.2 Make sure that you have python version >3.7
2.3 Open terminal, and use 'cd path' to go inside the folder.
2.4 Run virtual environment using command: source myvirtualenv/eatsPro/bin/activate
2.5 install packages using command: pip install -r requirements.txt(will introduce error)
2.6 use pip install to install psycopg2-binary==2.9.1,gunicorn==20.1.0
2.7 pip install â€”no-dependencies django-heroku
2.8 pip install -r requirements.txt
2.9 migrate all database using command
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.oy migrate
2.10 python manage.py runserver
2.11 go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Notice that the reason of 2.5-2.8 is that django-heroku has dependencies on psycopg2 and gunicorn, but psycopg2 is not well-prepared for install on many systems or versions. Thus, we use psycopg2-binary to instead psycopg2. So we need to install psycopg2-binary and gunicorn in advance and then install django-heroku with no dependencies.
